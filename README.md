# DeepLearningTutorials
Tutorial from [http://deeplearning.net](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html)

This tutorial aims to provide an example of how a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture can be implemented using Theano. In this tutorial, this model is used to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

It was tested with environment described below:
- Windows 10
- Anaconda3 4.4.0 with Python 3.6.1
- Theano 0.9.0
- Strawberry 5.12.3.0
